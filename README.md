# MELFORMS

The main idea is to provide a simple renderer component that receives a json configuration
and outputs a somewhat complex form. The objective is for the json configuration to be as simple and
understandable as possible.

This project was created to solve a use case I face daily. This will be basically my
"ideal solution" and I expect at some point to be able to implement this into my work.
I decided to keep it as a personal project because I wanted it to be a generic solution
that later will be integrated.

More documentation on the future when the concept evolves a bit more.

## Usage

Project created using SolidJS Typescript Vite template. To install just run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Documentation

Pseudo documentation can be found on the following drive link: <br>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o82WoL4cmDkzydvw96o0VbXDrEGfwJWTKY9sqqit3GI/edit?usp=sharing

As the project grows larger I will be creating a proper documentation site.
